## Benefits of version control :

* Remembers each version update
  * keeps a history between updates (changes made)
  * Rollback to previous version allowed
* Copies made on a local system can be easily synchronised
  * allows for efficient collaboration and version control of files
* Collaboration made easy
  * changes can be overlapping
    * allows members to work on same file simultaneously without conflicts
    * simultaneous updates, merging is also supported
